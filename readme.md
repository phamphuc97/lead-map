# Lead in Water Service Lines Map
Welcome to the Lead in Water Service Lines Map! This project is currently under construction and aims to provide users with information about lead in water service lines. While the current version allows users to search for addresses and view the map, we're continuously working on adding more features. Stay tuned for updates as we enhance the functionality to provide even more detailed information about specific addresses.

This project requires Node.js version 14 or higher. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
